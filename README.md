# Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains scheduling algorithms found in a book called __Handbook of Scheduling: Algorithms, Models, and Performance Analysis__, 
written by James H. Anderson and Joseph Y-T. Leung, published in 2004.

## Algorithms

### 1. Branch and Bound

This algorithm is currently developed, and will be written in Golang.

### 2. Moore-Hodgson

This algorithm has been implemented in Golang, and it's already finished. I plan to make more test cases to see if the algorithm is working as it is intended.

### 3. Kuhn-Munkres

I plan to write this in the future.
